[WHAT I LEARNED]
- Plan for a project, such as the flowchart of the program and what functions are needed to make it work.
- Using javascript for the first time
- Using sprite sheets and manipulating html to display and create an animation effect.
- Manipulate html DOM properties with javascript

[PROBLEMS I HAD]
- I had a problem trying to dynamically change "steps" property from "animation: moveSpriteSheet 1s steps(6) infinite;" in css, the way I overcome it is I just had the full string "animation: moveSpriteSheet 1s steps(x) infinite;" inserted to a css from javascript instead of just changing the "steps" property alone. 

[USAGE OF AI]
- I used help from ChatGPT to solve the problem above. I asked my TA first about the problem but he couldn't figure it out as my code was perfectly straight forward but for some reason is not working. Then I asked ChatGPT about the problem and it suggested to change the whole property instead of just "steps" property, which I didn't think to do. I learned that using AI helps you if you use it as a tool to learn, not for an easy way out.

[OVERALL]
- I'm happy with my final product as it is closely resembles what I had in mind from the initial design.
